# Product Listing Page with Vue.js

view website [here](https://plp-md.netlify.app/) ðŸ˜„

This is a simple web application that started as a tech challenge and has since been expanded with additional functionality and styling. The challenge involved implementing basic features, and after its completion, I decided to continue working on it, improving its functionality and appearance. Here's an overview of the changes I made:

- Sorting: I added the sorting feature that allows users to organise the products in three ways:
  1. High to Low: Sorts products in ascending order
  2. Low to High: Sorts products in descending order
  3. Relevance: Sorts products based on availability and ranking

- Styling: I integrated [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling

- Bug Fixes: I fixed a bug related to the filtering feature. The filtering functionality now works as expected.
